## Welcome to my GitHub profile!

#### I'm a recent UW Seattle graduate (summer 2022) and a full stack developer looking for my first full-time position as a professional SWE/GIS developer! 

My [resume](https://github.com/swierj/swierj/files/9892471/jacob_swierz_resume.pdf) :)

- I'm currently working on a full stack e-commerce website for a cosmetic business
- Also focusing on improving my programming and GIS skills, working on personal projects (mainly react based), and pursuing other hobbies in my spare time
- I'm hoping to start contributing to open source projects in the near future!
- Lastly, besides coding, I also love skiing, hiking, lifting, playing video games, and listening to music!

## How to navigate my GitHub?

- You can find my e-commerce project in the [nuvitta](https://github.com/swierj/nuvitta) repo and further information in the read.me!
- Other personal/group projects I have done will be in their respective repos
- My coursework from uni can be found in the [coursework](https://github.com/swierj/coursework) repo. Just a bunch of code!
