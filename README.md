## Welcome to my GitHub profile!

#### I'm a recent UW Seattle graduate with a bachelor's in Geography: Data Science looking for my first full-time position as a professional GIS/frontend developer! I have a passion for data analytics, specifically related to geography/GIS as well as frontend development and database architecture/management. I also plan on pursuing a master's in data science in the near future, after I find full-time employment.

Check out my [resume](swierz_resume_gds.pdf) :)

- I'm currently working on a full stack e-commerce website for a cosmetic business
- Also focusing on improving my backend and GIS skills, working on personal projects (mainly react based), and pursuing other hobbies in my spare time
- I'm hoping to start contributing to GIS open source projects in the near future!
- Lastly, besides coding, I also love skiing, hiking, lifting, playing video games, and listening to music!
