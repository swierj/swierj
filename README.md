- I'm currently working on a full stack e-commerce website for a cosmetic business
- I'm also applying for and seeking fulltime positions as a frontend/fullstack SWE
- Other than that I'm focusing on improving my programming skills, working on personal projects (mainly react based), and pursuing other hobbies in my spare time

## How to navigate my GitHub?

- You can find my e-commerce project in the "nuvitta" repo and further information in the read.me!
- Other personal/group projects I have done will be in their respective repos
- My coursework from uni can be found in the "coursework" repo. Just a bunch of code!
